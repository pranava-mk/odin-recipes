        <li>· Sugar: A cup of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
        <li>· Salt: You might not think a pinch of salt would make much of a difference, but you'll miss it if you don't use it..</li>
        <li>· Cranberries: Buy whole berries that are plump, firm, and unblemished. You can substitute frozen cranberries for fresh, but it will change the consistency of the batter.</li>
        <li>· Nuts: This recipe calls for walnuts, but you can pecans if you'd rather.</li>
        <li>· Eggs: Whole eggs add moisture and bind the batter together.</li>
